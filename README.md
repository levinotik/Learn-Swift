# Learn Swift

While reading the docs mentioned below, try typing out the examples in an Xcode "Playground" (from Xcode, click File -> New -> Playground). 

Read the Swift language documentation on [Declaring Constants and Variables](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID310). 

*What's the difference between the keywords `let` and `var`?*

Read the docs on [Functions](
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH10-ID158).

Skim through the docs on [Strings](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID285). After skimming quickly, 
read the [part on how to concatenate strings](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID291) (a fancy word for add together).


## Exercise 1

Still in a Playground, implement a function named `lengthOfJoinedString` which takes two Strings as arguments and returns the length of both Strings added together. The length of a String is the number of characters in it. 

You can use the `count` function to get the length of a String. For example `count("hi")` prints `2`. Don't worry about where `count` from.

If you implemented the function correctly then `lengthOfJoinedStrings("hello", "world")`, for example, should print `10` since "helloworld" has 10 characters.
